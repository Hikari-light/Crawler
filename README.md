Hello! I’m a web scraping engineer based in China.

I specialize in human‑like crawling tools to extract data from standard HTML pages, as well as from dynamically rendered content.

I’m also experienced in extracting information from PDFs and images.

I deliver clean, structured output in CSV or JSON formats. Typical delivery time: 2–4 days.

I have handled common anti‑scraping challenges, including:
- Headless browser simulation
- CAPTCHA solving
- Rate‑limiting bypass
- IP rotation

I’m comfortable communicating in written English or via English‑subtitle video messages, though I do not speak English fluently.

If you need reliable, high‑quality data extraction services, feel free to reach out.
