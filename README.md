## Hello! I’m a web scraping engineer based in China.
I specialize in human‑like crawling tools to extract data from standard HTML pages.
I am also skilled at retrieving content from PDFs and images.
I can deliver clean, structured output in CSV or JSON formats.
I have experience bypassing common anti‑scraping measures, including:
# Headless browser simulation
# CAPTCHA handling
# Rate‑limiting workarounds
# IP rotation
I am comfortable communicating in written English or via English‑subtitle video messages, though I do not speak English fluently.
If you need reliable, high‑quality data extraction and cleaning services, feel free to reach out.
