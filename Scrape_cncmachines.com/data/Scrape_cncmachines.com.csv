SHIPPING/FREIGHT:  
LOCAL PICKUP:  
Local pickups are preferred. The machine weighs approximately 1300 lbs, and requires a forklift, or pallet jack to move.  
If you are able to provide your own forklift, I will come down $1,000.00 off of my asking.  
LTL FREIGHT:  
If shipping is required, logistics costs are the responsibility of The Buyer. LTL freight can be arranged through your carrier, or if need be, through ours.  
If freight is required, Buyer will have the option for open pallets, with the machines being secured using a combination of shrink wrap, and timber framing, or fully enclosed crates.  
Both options are at the cost of The Buyer.  
\*OPEN PALLET W/SHRINK-WRAP  
$2,000.00 Surcharge. The machine will be secured for transport on an open pallet and shrink wrapped. Some timber framing will surround the machine, for added support, and stability. This option provides the least amount of protection.  
\*FULL ENCLOSURE CRATES  
Optional, at buyer's expense. The buyer has the option to request a full enclosure crate to maximize the protection for the machinery.   
A 3rd party onsite crating company will be contacted to crate the equipment onsite prior to logistics being scheduled. Pickup and transport will be subject to additional lead time by this vendor. The charges for that service will be invoiced directly to the buyer as a ""Shipping Preparation Surcharge"". Expected estimates for full enclosure crating of this machine should be approximately $2,500.00-$3,500.00  
We will be inclined to offer a discount of up to 30% off of the Shipping Preparation Surcharges, depending on whether or not we receive full asking for the machines that are for sale in this post.","Industrial Rotary Tool w/Chuck

Consequently, we have decided to sell this machine which has barely seen any use. It has been operated for only 10-20 hours, making this machine as good as new. This machine located in Pennsylvania is available immediately, providing an ideal opportunity for an interested buyer. Considered a triumph of contemporary engineering, this 2021 Desktop Metal Studio System 2 holds the potential to revolutionize any fabrication operations. Embracing the Bound Metal Deposition™ technology, this 3D printer utilizes a dual extruder assembly with quick-release print heads and two nozzle diameters for different resolutions. Despite its minimal usage, the system has been conscientiously looked after, ensuring it remains in prime working order. It features quite an impressive performance characteristic with X, Y, and Z axis travels at 12"", 8"", and 8"", respectively. The maximum build weight in the green state touches 6.5 kg (14.3 lbs), and the range of layer height varies from 50-150 µm, with the high-resolution printhead to 150-300 µm, possible with the standard resolution printhead. Being heated and offering a vacuum-enabled print bed, the build chamber of the printer ensures excellent control over the printing environment. The device also houses a 7-inch touchscreen display for intuitive interaction and onboard control of the printing tasks. The in-chamber build plate camera adds a layer of convenience by allowing for real-time monitoring. To mention about the power requirements, the 2021 Desktop Metal Studio System 2 can efficiently work on both 100-130 VAC, 50/60Hz, 15 A, 1-phase and 200-240 VAC, 50/60Hz, 10 A, 1-phase power sources, making it versatile in a variety of setups. Noticeable dimensions of 37.3"" x 32.4"" x 20.8"" make it compact enough to adjust in any workplace, whereas its weight is only about 214 lbs, making it reasonably mobile. In addition to the printer, we also offer a selection of extras, including more printer heads, additional accessories, and materials. These are not included in the base price of the printer, but can be discussed to be part of the transaction if desired. In summary, if you are seeking an almost new, low usage, remarkable 3D printer that holds the capability to support a broad spectrum of fabrication tasks, then this 2021 Desktop Metal Studio System 2 might be the perfect addition to your shop floor."

It has thus logged very low operational hours, with remarkably minimal wear and tear. Please look at the attached images for a clearer idea, and do not hesitate to get in touch if you need more pictures or have any questions.
The machine boasts a remarkable 10K High Power High Accel Spindle. It has never been used for actual drilling or milling operations and is in a wonderful operational state. The spindle system is engineered to deliver precise performance, ensuring your requirements will be met smoothly and effortlessly, every time.
The FANUC ROBODRILL is currently on a pallet, along with the coolant tank, as we have prepared it for shipping. Should you wish to inspect the machine physically before making a purchase decision, we can certainly accommodate such a request. The machine is still operational and can even be powered on to let you assess its superior performance firsthand.

2018 date of manufacture. Purchased in January 2020 from Trotec Laser.   
\*ORIGINAL OWNER!  
\*LESS THAN 700 HOURS ON THE TUBE!  
I have a second (non-operational) Gen. 1 Speedy 400 parts machine. I am willing to include some extra parts in the deal.   
If I receive my full asking, I will include the entire second machine.  
\*\*NOTE\*\*  
The second machine does NOT have the tube. It was acquired from another party who opted to write off the machine instead of repairing it, and they kept the tube for the other Trotec rigs in their fleet.  
SYSTEM FEATURES:  
-24"" x 39"" work area  
-120W CO2  
-Multiple (3) interchangeable beds (standard aluminum grid bed, ferromagnetic bed, downdraft bed)  
-Multiple lenses (1.5"", 2.0"", 2.5"", and 4.0"")  
-Micro PC with Trotec Ruby control software  
-Vision camera  
-Rotary tool with cone and rim drive attachments  
PRE-PURCHASE VIEWING/DEMONSTRATION:  
We can arrange a pre-purchase Meet/Facetime/Zoom/Skype meeting so that I can demonstrate the machine's functionality prior to purchase.  
If you are a local buyer, we can arrange for an in person demo.  
SHIPPING/FREIGHT:  
LOCAL PICKUP:  
Local pickups are preferred.  
The machines weigh approximately 750 lbs each, and are on casters, so they can easily be loaded on a trailer with a sturdy ramp, or loaded into a box truck with a lift gate.  
LTL FREIGHT:  
If shipping is required, logistics costs are the responsibility of The Buyer. LTL freight can be arranged through your carrier, or if need be, through ours.  
If freight is required, Buyer will have the option for open pallets, with the machines being secured using a combination of shrink wrap, and timber framing, or fully enclosed crates.  
Both options are at the cost of The Buyer.  
\*OPEN PALLET W/SHRINK-WRAP  
$1,500.00, or $750.00 per machine. The machines will be secured for transport on open pallets and shrink wrapped. Some timber framing will surround the machines for added support, and stability. This option provides the least amount of protection.  
\*FULL ENCLOSURE CRATES  
Optional, at buyer's expense. The buyer has the option to request a full enclosure crate to maximize the protection for the machinery.   
A 3rd party onsite crating company will be contacted to come out and crate the equipment onsite prior to logistics being scheduled. Pickup and transport will be subject to additional lead time by this vendor. Costs will be determined by the vendor at the time of quoting, but crating costs should be expected to be approximately $1,500.00 per machine.  
We will be inclined to offer a discount of up to 30% off of the Shipping Preparation Surcharges, depending on whether or not we receive full asking for the machines that are for sale in this post.","Additional Speedy 400 (Parts Machine)

Originally obtained for personal pursuits, this decidedly capable machine has clocked less than 100 operational hours over its lifetime, most of which were spent working with aluminum, with merely a small amount of steel added to the mix. The machine dates back to June 2018 and has since been dutifully operated, extending its high level of functionality and opera-ability. From its robust structure to its sturdy performance, this machine further validates its high manufacturing and processing standards. One of the enticing aspects of this modern machine is the ample tooling supply accompanying it. The package includes 13 TTS Tool Holders, the sought-after, as well as an interesting collection of Machining 101 paraphernalia — sets of parallels, collets, and more. Furthermore, a Haimer model is equipped within the machine, further widening its potential for accomplishment. Despite the machine's satisfactory condition, there’s one minor detail that needs attention: the replacement of the coolant site glass. The included one fell victim to the prevalent issue of cracking, long known to affect stock versions. Despite this minor setback, this machine continues to offer a high degree of precision and endurance. To ensure a smoother handover, professional rigging is available for the transportation of this rather impressive work-hub. This service shall aid in moving the machine onto new horizons without compromising its structural integrity. Switching hands after a brief stint of personal use, the machine’s readiness to take on newer challenges is unquestionable. Whether you're a hobbyist or a small-scale manufacturing unit, this Vertical Machining Center could serve as an invaluable addition to your workshop. The decision to part ways is not based on any operational inadequacy, but rather due to insufficient utilization. The machine has been admired and well-kept, but regrettably, hasn't seen enough action to justify its presence. In an ideal environment, this machine’s potential for production is significant. It could cater to a plethora of machining tasks with ease, provided it falls into the right, deserving hands. Lastly, it's vital to appreciate that this isn't about merely acquiring a machine—it's about welcoming a resourceful addition to your space, a talent that just needs the right setting to dazzle and deliver."

The LAGUNA SMARTSHOP M was used solely for the construction of a couple of stools - indeed, it was incredibly limited in its use and handled with utmost care from day one. This is easily reflected in the impeccable condition of the machine, which remains virtually indistinguishable from a brand new model. The machine carries an aura of a product that was treated with respect – a testament to the minimal hours of operation it was subjected to. One of the most intriguing features of this model is the provision of a Vacuum hold down. This option ensures that the materials being worked on are firmly held in place giving you a considerably safer working scenario while simultaneously increasing precision. Steadiness and accuracy during work are nothing short of paramount, and this system duly delivers on those ends. In addition to the core features of the 2018 LAGUNA SMARTSHOP M Router, I had also opted for an additional upgrade at my purchase - a Vacuum System. This system elevates the operational capabilities even further, enabling this router to hold your workpiece securely and unchecked throughout your entire project. This option, though might seem substantial, tremendously simplifies the process of cutting and shaping, making your tasks as simplistic and hassle-free as possible. To summarize, if you are in the market for a gently used, highly accurate, and sturdy router, do not miss this opportunity. This 2018 LAGUNA SMARTSHOP M Router, with all its prime features and upgrades, could be the perfect answer to your woodworking needs.

With less than three years of use, it is in good shape and ready for a new owner. I hope you’ll find its performance as superb as I have.
The A6-48 model emits a low level of noise during operation. This feature alone is a plus for any person who needs a quiet work environment. It also has an easy-to-adjust speed which gives you the freedom to work on various projects at your own pace. The speed dial is easy to figure out, even by a new user, thus saving you time because you can start work right away.
One thing you'll love about this product is its sleek design. Its look is clean and simple. But do not let the 'simple' fool you, this router is a good worker and it works with care. It is easy to set up, use and pack away when you’re done. The ease of use makes working with it a fun experience.
What’s more, this router has a soft oval shape grip. This design makes it easy to hold and work with for long periods. It also helps you control the tool well and can help keep accidents from happening. The firm hold this provides assists in getting the clean cuts you desire.
As is common with used items, this router has minor signs of wear and tear but nothing that impacts its operation. It comes in its original box with all tools it was bought with. Feel free to drop a note if you want to view or try out the router before you commit to buying.
All in all, this 2017 BAOSEN A6-48 Router has served me well and I believe it will do the same for you. Its build, easy operation and good output make it the right tool for a fan of woodwork. The price tag is fair for its quality and usage, so I'm sure it will make a great buy for its next owner."

Versa Flow Background:  
The Versa Flow line of machines is an ultra-high energy form of mass finishing. The  
power is created by a high-speed spinning tub filled with media and liquid compound.  
The centrifugal force produced by the spinning tub and weight of the media provides a  
form fitting abrasive mass. The part is mounted on a rotating spindle which presents  
the part to the rotating mass for processing. The spindle design allows for many  
different sizes of parts and presentations into the mass. The Roto-Spin is capable of  
processing parts in minutes or even seconds compared to traditional vibratory  
EZ Clean Tub Screen:  
Allows fluid to constantly flow through the tub. This flow removes the waste from media  
breaking down and the material from the processed part out of the tub. The rotating tub  
is perforated and covered with an easily removed fine wire mesh. For use with dry  
processing the wire mesh screen is replaced with a solid screen.  
Variable Hi-Speed Tub:  
The variable speed tub is controlled by a VFD. The speed in Surface Feet per Minute  
(SFM) is measured at the tub wall. This speed increases the centrifugal force applied to  
the media. This helps the compound flow through the tub and applies great amounts of  
force to the processed part. The tub is contained in a heavy duty structural base built to  
withstand the significant energy produced by the spinning tub. The tub is mounted on the  
output shaft of a heavy duty gear reducer.  
Tub Drain:  
Tub drain contains the liquid as centrifugal force pushes it out of the tub during  
processing. This drain collects the liquid and allows time for solids to settle. This helps  
in cleaning and recirculation of compound.  
VSF-1200P Spindle:  
The spindle is designed and constructed to withstand the force applied by the rotating  
media mass. The tilting of the spindle is done by a pneumatic cylinder. This tilt cylinder  
plunges the part into the mass. Securing the part to the spindle is done by a standard  
Hardinge style collet that is pneumatically operated. Urethane collet protectors are added  
to protect the tooling from the rotating mass. During the spindle process the part will run  
in both directions to fully present all critical part geometry to the media mass. After the  
process is completed the spindle blow-off will remove media from the tooling and part  
back into the tub. A Jog pushbutton and hand spray is also included to aid in part rinsing.  
Part positioning in the tub is critical to process performance. The spindle adjustments are  
explained in detail below.  
Spindle Drive:  
The rotating spindle turns the part in the mass in both CW and CCW directions. The 0-  
25rpm speed of the spindle is fully adjustable and controlled by the 1/4hp VFD.  
Vertical Adjustment:  
The vertical spindle adjustment positions the part just above the tub bottom. Total  
adjustment is 8”. Tooling length also determines part final position.  
Horizontal Adjustment:  
The horizontal spindle adjustment positions the part just inside the tub outer wall. Total  
adjustment is 12”.  
Camber Adjustment:  
The camber spindle adjustment positions the part at an angle to the tub bottom and tub  
outer wall. Total adjustment is 0-10°.  
Spindle Pivot:  
The spindle pivot locates the part in the mass during processing. With the spindle at 0°  
the part will be perpendicular to media flow. With a pivot angle of +10°(Lead) the part will  
be pivoted into the media flow 10°. With a -10°(Trail) pivot angle the part will be pivoted  
10° with the media flow. Total pivot adjustment is 15°in either direction from 0°. Total  
adjustment is 30°. The pivot actuator and servo valve accurately move the part during  
processing for optimal part coverage.  
Spindle Adjustment:  
The spindle set up is completely process dependent. Sample processing by  
Hammond Roto-Finish will help determine final adjustments.","","Pre-owned HAMMOND VERSA FLOW VSF1200P 2017 [Manual and Other Machining](https://cncmachines.com/manual-and-other-machining/l).

With such limited operation span placed on them, their base mechanics appear to be in optimal state of preservation, thus ensuring a high performance level for any potential buyer. These 3D printers were acquired in 2016 as demonstration printers and are in a near-new state. For prospective buyers who are most concerned about functionality, both printers are currently in a fully operational state. Notably, one of these printers boasts a brand new printing head. Any known issues with the printers? Absolutely none. Since our printing needs have recently expanded, which led to purchasing an Ultimaker printer that offers a broader range of material choices, these machines have been rendered purposeless for us. Simply put, we no longer utilize them. It is important to add that we are in no hurry to sell them, despite the fact that they are gradually accumulating dust. Included in this sale offer are some extras: wooden stands and additional material. Yet, they don't really add substantial value to the printers as such. As of a few months ago the printers were still under the Stratasys maintenance plan, which saw them undergoing checks and repairs just before the plan concluded in the spring. As such, they meet a high standard of functionality and are ready for their future user. Situated in Quebec, Canada, the printers understandably attract buyers who are ready to transport them to their desired location or negotiate the shipping terms. Allow me to give you an idea of this sale's fantastic value. These printers were initially priced at around $15,000 USD. However, they are now at a significantly lower price, thus offering a great bargain for any buyer. Their technical features would interest any savvy buyer. The printers come with ten inches of travel capacity on the X and Y axis, along with twelve inches on the Z axis. Their dimensions are 36'' x 27"" x 68,'' showing that, while substantial, they won't consume undue space in your location. The printers, each weighing 326 lbs, offer sturdy stability and long-lasting use. To sum it up, these Stratasys Dimension SST 1200ES printers are a pair of lightly used, highly functional machines that are super value for money. They are in prime condition and are eagerly waiting to be put to use by their future owner. So, hurry up and grab these incredibly under-utilized printers at a bargain, before someone else does!"

This fact, in conjunction with the strong reputation of Stratasys' equipment durability, provides good assurance of the machine's readiness for future tasks. While the printer doesn’t serve much purpose to us anymore, we want to assure you that this is not due to any decrease in its functional capacity. Our transition to an Ultimaker printer was instigated solely by a change in our specific material usage requirements and by no means reflects a discontentment with this 3D printer's performance. Our Stratasys Dimension SST 1200es was acquired in 2016 as a demo printer and has been fully functional ever since. As of the latest update, there are no known issues. Moreover, one of the printers boasts a new printing head. Incorporating X, Y, and Z-Axis Travel dimensions of 10"", 10"", and 12"" respectively, this printer operates within a compact space. The full dimensions of the equipment are 36"" x 27"" x 68"" and it weighs approximately 326 LBS. Previously maintained under the Stratasys service plan, the machine underwent regular checks and repairs, ensuring its smooth operation. Although the maintenance service was discontinued only a few months prior, it had served its purpose ensuring the machine's readiness to take on challenging 3D printing tasks while being in top-notch condition. This deal also includes some assorted extras. We have wooden stands and some additional material which we can provide along with the printer. When weighing the value this printer brings, it's commendable that it comes at a fraction of its original price. Initially, our Stratasys Dimension SST 1200es was acquired for $15,000 USD.

An interesting factor about this machinery is the reason why the owner chose to sell it - the fact that it was never actually used for any operations. While the machine was hooked up and ready to operate, it remained unused meaning that its physical and functional attributes are still in a highly impressive state.
The LNS Quick Load S3 has only minimal hours on it, indicating that while it was connected, it was never actually put to work. This allows potential buyers a unique opportunity to acquire a machine that, while technically considered 'used', has not really done any heavy work that would typically wear down its components. This highlights a significant advantage for any potential buyer as the machine has more or less the lifespan of a new machine at the cost of a used one.
As for its condition, the owner asserts that it is in a commendable state. This implies that though the QUICK LOAD S3 is a 2005 model, it retains the robustness and sturdiness of a relatively newer machinery. Thus, the machine does not need any immediate repairs or replacement parts. Its superior physical condition suggests its potential to cater to your operational needs over a prolonged period of time, making it a valuable addition to your production line.
Another noteworthy point about this machine is the seller's time frame for the sale. The QUICK LOAD S3 is currently available and ready to be sold. Therefore, you will not have to worry about any prolonged waiting times as could be the case with some other pre-owned machinery sellers. This machine boasts a combination of features that make it an attractive acquisition for businesses seeking to reduce operational costs without compromising on the output quality.
In conclusion, this 2005 LNS QUICK LOAD S3 handling machine offers a unique opportunity for potential buyers. With its minimal usage hours, great condition, and immediate availability, it holds the promise of delivering the high performance you expect from such a machine whilst discernibly lowering your investment costs. Securing this machine could substantially optimize your operations and lead to significant cost savings in the long run."

We bought this CNC Lathe new and primarily used it for machining aluminum and 12L14 soft materials. It was running well when we took it out of service. One component we did not use is the live center, not due to any issues, but simply because it was not required in our operations. The machine is currently stored and is not under power at the moment.
The decision to remove it from operation was based on a pending sale that ultimately did not go through, leaving the lathe available for a new owner. While it shows some signs of use, such as being a bit oily and dirty, functionality remains intact.

This 2006 LVD STRIPPIT product Laser is no longer in operation but has the potential to be functional again with a few new parts. This machine requires a specific part that we have decided not to replace due to cost considerations.
The laser system was previously used in our facility for cutting applications, demonstrating its capability and strength in handling various tasks. The machine is currently not running, which means it will need some attention before it can return to its former state.
For buyers who are familiar with laser systems and have access to necessary parts, this machine presents a great opportunity. It could be a valuable addition once operational again. While it requires investment to bring it back to working condition, it could be a suitable project for someone with the needed skills or resources.
We are offering this laser as is, and it will be up to the new owner to source and install the required parts. For those interested in a hands-on project or who have spare parts on hand, this could be a viable option.
Please feel free to reach out with any questions or if you would like more information about the machine's previous use and current condition. This laser is being sold with the understanding that it will need some work to become operational again.

It's been quite an instrumental tool in my workshop but it's time to part ways as I navigate through the process of closing down my woodwork shop. The router, while aged, still performs well with some minor wear and tear typical of its age and usage.
It's important to note that the controller was replaced and this has tampered with the router's ability to record working hours accurately. Therefore, it's quite challenging to give an exact estimate of the number of hours it has run. Regardless, the condition of the machine speaks for itself, pointing to a fair degree of use.
Though the router is generally in working order, the vacuum pump has developed a bearing squeal. This might need attention in order to optimize its performance. The router is capable of offering Rapids at 3000 ipm, Cut at 1500 ipm, and comes with a 20 HP vacuum pump. Alongside these features are several upgrades including a Vacuum System which significantly enhances the functionality of the machine.
Also included in this sale is an updated Multicam dongle and 10 tool holders to help kick start your operations. The router also comes with a 5x5 drill head and runs on a 3 phase power system which is common for machinery of this type. It's worth noting the router has been operated with attention to preserve its integrity and lifespan as much as possible.
In terms of timeline, I am open to selling this router immediately, hence keen buyers can reach out at their earliest convenience. Additionally, attached to this listing are photos of the router to provide a clear depiction of its current state. Remember, the purpose of sale is purely because I am winding up my workshop and not due to any significant issues with the router.
In essence, by purchasing this used 2003 MULTICAM router, you’ll be investing in a valuable piece of machinery that, despite its age, still has plenty to offer in terms of performance and functionality."

The system does not present any signs of damage, and all parts are operating in a splendid fashion. However, it is significant to mention that while the hardware is working perfectly fine, the challenge exists in integrating that hardware with the operating software. We have expertised in getting the device up and running but there has been trouble interfacing with the software, largely due to lack of knowledge in our team. This challenge might not exist if the next users have prior experience in operating such systems.
Our prime motive of selling this machine is its absence of use. The machine has not seen much action in the recent past. While this might seem to be a downside, it is also the biggest USP of this appliance. A caveat emptor, the device has been idle but that does not translate to its efficiency or functional integrity being compromised. Infact, it being in a state of rest, the wear and tear usually associated with use is entirely absent, promising a greater lifespan if put to use immediately. This piece of hardware has been kept idle, as we had acquired it with the intention of exploring a new line of production, which didn't materialize. Hence it has had limited use in its brief stay with us and spent more time idle than it should.
The availability and delivery of this ROFIN POWERLINE E Laser System will not be an issue. This laser machine is available as soon as possible due to its under-utilization at our end. Thus, the transition for a new home can take place promptly. We are situated in New Jersey and welcome all interested purchasers to discuss their delivery requirements.

Although the exact hours of operation are uncertain, rest assured that the center functions as it should, apart from a mechanical issue involving one or more worn 'teeth/keys' in the tool changer. Knowledge of CNC is not needed to understand this issue. Otherwise, the machine has no electrical issues of any sort.
With the machine, you will also get three sizable vices and a substantial inventory of tool holders, perfect for any project you need to take on. An additional benefit is a Stevens sub plate, which provides extra convenience and flexibility in machining tasks.
While there's no immediate pressure to sell, we believe it's time to let go of this machine. It hasn't been used for a month and is simply bigger than what we need in our current operations. We are prioritizing floor space and have recently bought a smaller Haas DT2, which we have successfully transitioned to, with all the programs re-written for the Haas. The LEADWELL Vertical Machining Center, thus, needs a new home.
The machine uses a Fanuc CNC Control—a recognized industry standard—offering a focused control environment for your machining jobs. Notably, an optional upgrade includes a Chip Conveyor, a nice-to-have feature for managing the disposal of waste during operations.
This 1999 LEADWELL Vertical Machining Center is a simple, straight-forward workhorse, ready and capable to help in your next big project. No flowery words, just the facts you need to make your purchasing decision.

Rigid Tapping","This 1998 HAAS VF3 Vertical Machining Center stands as a testament to the evolution of industrial machinery. It continues to hold its ground in today's highly automated era. This production machine boasts a variety of key upgrades that has sustained its operational relevance for many years. These improvements include a 10,000 RPM rate, which means it works super fast. It also features Rigid Tapping, an option that allows you to tap directly into your workpiece without the need for an extra tapping head. This feature helps to cut down work time, enhancing the machine's overall productivity.
This machine's key advantage lies in its highly upgraded features, cementing its place in the world of machining. Equipped with HAAS’ high-speed machining option (HSM), the machine allows you to carry out 3D milling tasks much faster than typical machines. This is possible due to HSM's ability to keep the cutting tool engaged with the workpiece, regardless of the shape being machined.
The Rigorous tapping feature provides the machine with an added capability to perform tapping operations with ease and at high speeds.
